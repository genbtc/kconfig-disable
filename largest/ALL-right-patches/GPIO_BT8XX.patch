BT8XX GPIO abuser
The BT8xx frame grabber chip has 24 GPIO pins that can be abused
as a cheap PCI GPIO card.

This chip can be found on Miro, Hauppauge and STB TV-cards.

The card needs to be physically altered for using it as a
GPIO card. For more information on how to build a GPIO card
from a BT8xx TV card, see the documentation file at
Documentation/driver-api/gpio/bt8xxgpio.rst

If unsure, say N.
Depends: VIDEO_BT848=n
